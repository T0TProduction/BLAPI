# BLAPI - the BotListAPI
BLAPI is a package to handle posting your discord bot stats to botlists.<br>
It's intended to be used with discord.js, though you can also manually post your stats.<br><br>
BLAPI fully supports sharding when using [metalists API](https://metalist.xyz/api/docs#count), but not **yet** when manually posting.<br>
# Installation
Install via npm (recommended) <br>
```npm i blapi``` 
# Usage
The list of all supported bot lists and their respective names for the apiKeys object are listed [below](https://github.com/T0TProduction/BLAPI#lists)
<br><br>
### With discord.js:

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const blapi = require("blapi");

let bot = new Discord.Client({ autoReconnect: true });

//post to the APIs every 60 minutes; you can leave out the repeat delay as it defaults to 30
//if the interval is below 3 minutes BLAPI will not use metalists API because of ratelimits
blapi.handle(bot, apiKeys, 60); 
```
### Manually, without need of discord libs:

```js
//postWithoutMetalist is a optional boolean if you don't want to use metalists API
//consider adding it if you get ratelimited from bot lists
blapi.manualPost(guildCount, botID, apiKeys, postWithoutMetalist);
```
### apiKeys
The JSON object which includes all the API keys should look like this:
```js
{
"bot list domain": "API key for that bot list",
etc.
}
```
an example would be:
```js
{
"bots.ondiscord.xyz" : "aönvtauitnzvaltnvalztnbvaeöituvnautzcn",
"discordbots.org" : "nzovrzunwlvuaznwtvclawnztvcaöznhtcauhntclagbt"
}
```

# Lists
This is a list of all supported discord bot lists: <br>
- "botsfordiscord.com"
- "bots.ondiscord.xyz"
- "boatlist.ml": 
- "botlist.space": 
- "discordboats.club"
- "discordbots.fr"
- "discordbots.org"
- "discordbot.world"
- "bots.discord.pw"
- "discordbots.group"
- "discord.services"
- "listcord.com"
   
These lists are supported by being hardcoded, but BLAPI will always look for new additions on startup via the [metalist API](https://metalist.xyz/api/docs#lists)<br><br>
If at any time you find other bot lists have added an API to post your guildcount, let us know on this repo or by contacting T0TProduction#0001 on Discord.

# Credit
All the people who helped making BLAPI are listed in [AUTHORS](https://github.com/T0TProduction/BLAPI/blob/master/AUTHORS)<br>
By default we use the [metalist API](https://metalist.xyz/api/docs#count) to post all the data
